#### What is Good Vibrations?

>  Good Vibrations is an app that allows the users to receive messages without the need to look at the phone.

#### Why is Good Vibrations being developed?

> This is a project that aims to reveal whether you can communicate by using vibrations instead of sounds and text. Similar to the Morse code, but with vibrations instead of visual feedback.

**How:** An app that let friends communicate simple messages via taps and vibrations. In the app, the dictionary is shared between persons who are connected in the app, and can be changed to accommodate the vocabulary and most frequent phrases between the persons. When a person enters a message and sends it to their friend, the friend is notified by vibrations. The physical access is the messages, that can contain information that should not be seen by anyone else. 

### Main Screens

Authorization is done by entering your phone number which the user is linked to. | A code is sent to the user phone number and the app asks for this code. | When tapping in a message, the user can see a preview of that message before sending.

Enter a phone number or scan a QR code to add a contact. | History of received messages. Click a message to play it. | In the settings screen, the user can change various settings.


The user can switch in what mode the messages are being sent, either every tap is sent instantly or the user can tap out the whole message before sending. Messages can be tapped in without opening the app by assigning an activate button, messages are sent when the button is released.

### Dictionary Screens

The dictionary is shared between the user and the contact and can be edited by both. | A word or phrase can be edited by changing what it stands for and how the vibrations are assigned. | When deleting an entry in the dictionary, the user must accept the deletion in two steps.

### Future Work

The app is right now in stage of being developed. Some changes will be made to the design during development. This site will be updated during the process.
