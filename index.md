## What is Good Vibrations?

Good Vibrations is an app that allows you to receive messages without the need to look at the phone. The messages are just vibrations, and you can define your own dictionary with phrases that you and a friend use frequently, unless you want to use a complex existing alphabet such as Morse code. With Good Vibrations, you can send secret messages in plain sight - no one except you and your friend knows what the vibrations mean.
