## Features, definitley not bugs

When the app starts it will recieve the latest message from the database, the app is unresponsive when recieving messages. This is a feature, not a bug!

Right now there can only be one message in the database at a time, sending a message will be recieved by all running apps including yours. Please dont spam messages! 

---

The app requires no extra files, just download the files, import it into Android Studio and run it.


Some views only contains dummy data, these views are: **Dictionary view**, **Settings view** and **Message History view**. These views have no functionality, they serve mostly as a placeholder to showcase whats to come.
