## Features, definitley not bugs

When the app starts it will recieve the latest message from the database, the app is unresponsive when recieving messages. This is a feature, not a bug!

Right now there can only be one message in the database at a time, sending a message will be recieved by all running apps including yours. Please dont spam messages!

The app requires no extra files, just download the files, import it into Android Studio and run it.
