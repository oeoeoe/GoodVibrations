## Features, definitley not bugs

When the app starts it will recieve the latest message from the database, the app is unresponsive when recieving messages. This is a feature, not a bug!

Right now there can only be one message in the database at a time, sending a message will be recieved by all running apps including yours. Please dont spam messages!
