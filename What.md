title: What is Good Vibrations?
---

Here we will describe what Good Vibrations is and how it works.

## The Challenge

Private messages can contain sensitive and secret information that no one but the recipient is supposed to see. A question that we have set out to solve is: How can you send and receive secret messages via cellphones without the need of hiding the screen from others?

## The Solution

In Good Vibrations, messages are secured by being sent as vibrations instead of plain text. The idea is that the vibrations should be strong enough so that the recipient can feel the individual vibrations with their phone in their pocket, but not too strong so that the someone else could hear the phone’s vibrations. The information is hidden in plain sight - because the vibrations are in a code that only the people with access to the private dictionary knows. Even if someone else were to overhear the vibrations, they wouldn’t know what it meant. 

By sending short codes in the form of vibrations, you can quickly and discreetly send messages that you don’t want anyone except your friend to see. Just tap a predefined sequence of long and short taps, and send the message by swiping right. Your friend will receive the message as vibrations matching your taps. In the app, you and your friend can define a dictionary so that a short set of short and long vibrations can convey something of importance to you, such as a place to meet, or the name of a secret crush.


## Screenshots with descriptions

The user can switch in what mode the messages are being sent, either every tap is sent instantly or the user can tap out the whole message before sending. Messages can be tapped in without opening the app by assigning an activate button, messages are sent when the button is released.
